# Configuration file for porkbun-api bash script
# https://github.com/corey-braun/porkbun-api-bash

# Any commands in this file will be run when it is sourced/executed by the main script.
# It is therefore recommended to restrict access to this file as much as possible (i.e. `chmod 600`)
# Valid configuration variables are listed below with their default values, uncomment/change them as needed.
# Flags/arguments provided when calling the script will take precedence over variables set in this file.

# Required variables
DOMAIN=  # The domain name for the script to act on. Can also be set by flag '-d <domain>'.
APIKEY=  # Your Porkbun API Key
SECRETKEY=  # Your Porkbun API Secret Key

# SSL Cert Retrieval variables
#SSL_FOLDER="/ssl/$DOMAIN"  # The folder to output SSL certs to for the 'retrieve-ssl' command.
#CHECK_CURRENT_CERT=true  # Check if SSL cert is already up to date before writing retrieved certs. Setting this to 'false' will write to SSL cert files every run.
#certificatechain_name=fullchain  # If set, replaces 'certificatechain' with this variable's value in the name of the cert file that gets written.
#intermediatecertificate_name=intermediate  # If set, replaces 'intermediatecertificate' with this variable's value in the name of the cert file that gets written.
#privatekey_name=  # If set, replaces 'privatekey' with this variable's value in the name of the cert file that gets written.
#publickey_name=  # If set, replaces 'publickey' with this variable's value in the name of the cert file that gets written.

# Logging variables; By default, any messages with a priority at or below VERBOSITY are output to both stdout and file LOGFILE.
# Setting SILENT to 'true' disables output to stdout. Unsetting LOGFILE or setting it to an empty string disables output to a log file.
#VERBOSITY=5  # Max verbosity of script's messages to output and log, valid values are 0-7; 0 only outputs on fatal errors; 3 outputs on warnings; 4 outputs when changes are made; 5 outputs when no changes are needed; 6 outputs a message stating what the script will do this run; 7 walks through all the steps the script takes (debug mode). Can also be set via flag '-v <verbosity>'.
#SILENT=false  # Disables output to STDOUT if set to 'true'. Can also be set to true via flag '-s'.
#LOGFILE="/tmp/porkbun-api-$USER.log"  # File to output log messages to. If unset or set to an empty string no output will be logged.

# Other variables
#A_RECORD_NUM=0  # Which DNS A record to update with 'update-dns' command. This should not be changed unless the domain you are updating has multiple A records. The A record with the oldest creation date (which has the lowest porkbun "id") is 0, records created later are addressed in ascending order.
#IP_VERSION=''  # The IP version for curl to use when making API calls. If using command 'update-dns' this will always be overridden to '-4'. Can also be set via flags '-4' or '-6'.
